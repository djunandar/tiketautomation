Handling issue force closed Android.
1. tell the developer how all the possible case why is it force close
2. rise to the product owner about the solution I made.
3. Grooming together and decide what solution is the best.

Severity level is High, because force closed is blocker to User. In my experience, logged-in users have a great opportunity to use the application and make payments.
Besides that, if the user just wants to browse Tiket Product like a Plane ticket or Hotel booking, the user can do it without logging in and usually do it on the Tiket.com website. In this case, users who have registered and installed the ticket application will usually make a transaction.

the conclusion is, if there are blockers that can affect the company's profits, it must be resolved immediately. because the impact is bad either for the company or for the user experience.
